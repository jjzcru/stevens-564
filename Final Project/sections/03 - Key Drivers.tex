\section{Key Drivers}
\subsection{Small Businesses}
The reason that we are building this application is to help small businesses to 
compete with the big stores. Because of COVID, small businesses are now forced 
to migrate their operations online. Big companies like Amazon and Shopify were 
online since the beginning, Walmart, Target, and BestBuy have their main 
operations in store but they also had an online presence. \newline

\noindent Since these companies already have their delivery 
service, they are now focusing on improving and refining their e-commerce 
experience. This puts small businesses in peril since they already work with 
small profit margins, to begin with, they lack the capital to hire the 
technical skills required to create an online presence. \newline

\subsection{Unemployment}
\noindent Not only small businesses are affected, since the beginning of the 
pandemic unemployment has been rising, particularly in the US. Thatâ€™s why this 
application does not only help small businesses but also helps people who have 
their method of transportation and want to make extra money by fulfilling 
orders from the platform.\newline

\noindent This application will help small businesses and people without jobs 
while also helping to keep social distancing during the pandemic, now people 
more than ever are ordering online, so this is a good opportunity for a new 
player to get into the market.

\subsection{Health Risk}
\noindent Since the beginning of the pandemic, stores are required to shut 
down or limit the number of people they can have inside the stores, which 
translates into fewer sales for the merchants. Going to the store also 
increases customer exposure to the virus.\newline

\noindent With the application, we can reduce the number of people inside the 
stores while also helping the businesses to keep their sales.

\subsection{Convenience}
\noindent We want to enable our customers to have the same experience that they 
receive while ordering fast food. For this reason, we want to create an 
application that makes the purchase experience as seamless as possible.
